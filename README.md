# Discounted cash flow model
It's a calculator to valuate company stock value based on its discounted cash flow.

In order to get stock price from this model, you need to insert input data. Then the preliminary results will pop up, including cost of equity and cost of debt. Then you have to evaluate cost of capital after number of years chosen.

The formula is cost of capital = cost of debt * debt + cost of equity * market cap. You will also need to estimate future growth. Then after insertion of these estimates the stock price can be obtained.
